        "We tend to reproduce in adulthood what we learned in childhood. The way we received affection during that phase of life directly impacts how we relate as adults. In general, adults who become emotionally needy are those who did not receive the necessary attention and affection to develop self-esteem and belief in their autonomy.

Anger is a natural, adaptive response to threats; it triggers powerful, often aggressive feelings and behaviors that allow fighting or defending when attacked. Some amount of anger is necessary for our survival. However, we cannot vent on every person or object that irritates or upsets us; laws, social norms, and common sense set limits on how we express our anger. People use a variety of processes, both conscious and unconscious, to manage these feelings in effective and socially appropriate ways.",

The level of attachment is so significant that the person feels bad and suffers when the other is not around.

The danger is that by not allowing the external expression of anger, it may manifest internally, leading to physical problems such as anxiety, depression, hypertension, etc.",
    "F3":
        "3) Calming/relaxing. This involves not only controlling behavioral expression but also managing internal responses. Ideally, even the feelings themselves are softened. Failure to adequately express anger can lead to other problems, such as passive-aggressive behavior or a perpetually cynical and hostile attitude. People who constantly belittle others, criticize everything, or make cynical comments often haven’t learned to express their anger constructively. They typically have few satisfactory relationships. However, be cautious! This shouldn't be used as an excuse to 'let it all out.' Research shows that venting anger in uncontrolled ways can foster even more aggression rather than resolve the issue. It's better to understand the triggers for anger and develop strategies to prevent harmful escalation.",

A genuine smile, known as Duchenne's smile, involves the muscles around the eyes, partially closing them, and conveying warmth and sincerity. A fake smile only moves the mouth and lacks the sincerity of a true smile. These 'statue smiles' resemble the impersonal expressions seen on mannequins or in people smiling out of obligation.",
